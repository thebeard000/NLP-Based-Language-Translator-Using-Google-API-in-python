## Key Features

- Multimodal Translation: Enables translation from speech to target language via speech and text inputs.

- Revolutionary OCR Text-to-Speech: Translates text from images into speech for image-based content translation.

- Automatic Language Recognition: Automatically identifies the language of the text or chat.

- Automatic Spell Checker: Detects and highlights misspelled words before translation.

- Specialized Dictionaries: Allows the use of dictionaries tailored to specific topics for more accurate translation.

- Do Not Translate Capability: Marks and excludes specific text from translation, ensuring accuracy for proper names and places.



## Text Processing Algorithms

The Multilingual Language Translator with OCR incorporates various text processing algorithms to enhance the translation experience:

- **Tokenization**: Tokenization splits a text into smaller units, such as words or sentences. This process helps in analyzing and translating text effectively.

- **Stemming**: Stemming reduces words to their base form, for example, converting "running" to "run." This helps in handling variations of words during translation.

- **Lemmatization**: Lemmatization converts words to their base form while considering context and part-of-speech (POS). It ensures more accurate translations by preserving the meaning of words.

## Speech Processing Techniques

The application also includes speech processing techniques to handle spoken language:

- **Speech Recognition**: Speech recognition is used to convert spoken language into text, making it possible to translate spoken conversations.

- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: POS tagging identifies the grammatical components of speech in a sentence, aiding in the understanding and translation of context.

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: NER identifies and extracts relevant information such as names, places, and dates from speech, making translations more context-aware.

## Text-Image Processing Techniques

In addition to text and speech processing, the application utilizes text-image processing techniques:

- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: OCR technology is used to convert printed or handwritten text from images into machine-readable text. This feature enables the translation of text from various sources, including images.

- **Object Recognition**: Object recognition identifies and labels objects in an image, providing additional context for translation when images contain objects or scenes.

- **Text Detection and Extraction**: Text detection and extraction techniques are employed to detect and extract text from images. This ensures that text content within images can be accurately translated.
